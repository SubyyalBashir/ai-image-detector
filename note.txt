1. Install all the dependencies listed in requirements.txt section.
Some dependencies are not needed as I was experimenting various ways.

2. Work.py works to an image of a whole face while the crop_detection.py leverages computer vision techniques
to crop the picture of a human face. (Thanks OpenCV)

3. I used some experiment data in the data/df/ folder with names instead of numbers on it for the crop section. I am submitting it all collectively
